<b>Late discoveries</b>:
This cub3d only manages rectangular maps, at the time when I passed it, I thought that the maps should be because of the subject showed it like that. I also thought that exit returned all of the memory allocated during the program, but not the memory lost after redefining a variable. Also parsing error, if one of my texture paths is not initialized then the crash program when we look towards the wall with the texture that was to be displayed.
I am particularly sorry, and I am too far in the curriculum to be able to redo validate the correct project. Ultimately, in my spare time, I would settle all that, HF!

This is my cub3D project from the 42 cursus,
